# WebScrappingProjects

This Repo contains two projects to study web scrapping with selenium, beautifulsoup and request libs.

[2048 Robot player](https://github.com/marcos-mansur/WebScrappingProjects/blob/main/2048_roboto_v4.ipynb) - Jupyter notebook with code to launch a selenium web 
browser and to play  [2048](https://play2048.com) following a defined sequence of moves, recording the numbers at the table in each move in a dictionary. 

[Robot to download book covers](https://github.com/marcos-mansur/WebScrappingProjects/blob/main/download_book_covers.py) - a robot that download all the book 
covers from the website 'https://inventwithpython.com/'. Purely for practicing, not useful at all. lmao.
